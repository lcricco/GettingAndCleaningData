#Getting and Data Cleaning - Project

##Steps of this project

1. Download source data from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.
2. Unzip to your working directory.
3. Copy run_analysis.R to your working directory.
4. Execute the script run_analysis.R from that directory.

##What will be performed

The file "run_analysis.R" will perform the follow steps:

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Tidy this into a single data frame containing just the original data cells of interest, in the desired format.
- Name the activities in the data set.
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- Create a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- Export this tidy data set to your working directory.
